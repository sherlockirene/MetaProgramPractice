# Metaprogram Practice

### Why do I create this repos ?

As solving a problem with a complex struct, I implemented the algorithm like **practice1**, the repetition of operation codes makes me annoyed. Fortunately, I find a solution with **MetaProgram** and **Micro Function** tech in C plus plus. So I decided to improve the **practice1**, If you have any better solution than **practice2**, please tell me, **Thanks**..
